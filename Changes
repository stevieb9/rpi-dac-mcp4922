Revision history for RPi-DAC-MCP4922

2.36.3  2017-02-22
        - WiringPi::API prereq now v2.36.6, as that distribution was updated to
          correct a few build/installation issues

2.36.2  2017-02-21
        - renamed one of the datasheets (mcp48**.pdf to mcp48xx.pdf) due to
          the package not being able to be unpackaged on Win32 platforms
          (reported by Alexandr Ciornii) (closes #1)
        - brought version up to par with the rest of the RPi modules that
          require wiringPi C libs
        - forgot to modify changes for the proper version (d'oh!)

0.01    2017-02-01
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
