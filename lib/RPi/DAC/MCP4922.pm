=head1 NAME

RPi::DAC::MCP4922 - Interface to the MCP49x2 series digital to analog converters
(DAC) over the SPI bus

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Interface to the MCP49x2 series Digital to Analog Converters (DAC) over the SPI
bus. These units have two onboard DACs, which are modified independently.

The MCP4902 has 8-bit resolution (max 255 data value), the MCP4912 has 10-bit
resolution (max val 1023), and the MCP4922 has 12-bit resolution (max val
4095).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $dac = RPi::DAC::MCP4922->new(

        model   => 'MCP4922', # mandatory
        channel => 0,         # mandatory (SPI channel)
        cs      => 18,        # mandatory (GPIO pin num)
        buf     => 0,         # optional, default
        gain    => 1,         # optional, default
    );

    my ($dacA, $dacB) = (0, 1);

    $dac->set($dacA, 4095); # 100% output
    $dac->set($dacB, 0);    # 0% output

    $dac->disable_sw($dacB); # shuts onboard DAC B down
    $dac->enable_sw($dacB);  # turns it back on

    # NOTE

    # the SHDN pin on the IC is normally tied to 3.3v+ or 5v+ which
    # signifies that the DACs are always available. This SHDN pin
    # enables you to disable both DACs by pulling this pin LOW

    # to enable this functionality, connect the ICs SHDN pin to a GPIO
    # pin, then in the new() call, add the following param:

    shdn => 19 # GPIO pin num

    # if you do use this hardware feature, you MUST make a call to
    # enable_hw() after initialization of the object before you can
    # use either of the onboard DACs

    my $dac->enable_hw();

    ...

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiates a new L<RPi::DAC::MCP4922> object, sets up the GPIO and SPI, and
returns the object.

Parameters:

All parameters are sent in as a hash.

There are three mandatory parameters, the rest are optional with very sane
defaults.

    model => $str

Mandatory: String. The model number of the MCP49xx DAC you're controlling.

    channel => $int

Mandatory: Integer. C<0> for SPI channel 0, or C<1> for SPI channel 1.

    cs => $int

Mandatory: Integer. The GPIO pin number connected to the DACs CS pin.

    buf => $int

Optional: Integer. C<0> for unbuffered output, and C<1> for buffered. This
software does not at this time use the C<LDAC> latch pin, so leave this to the
default of C<0> (unbuffered).

    gain => $int

Optional: Integer. Sets the gain amplifier. C<1> for 1x gain (0v to 255/256 *
Vref), and C<0> for 2x gain (0v to 255/256 * 2 * Vref). Defaults to C<1>, or 1x
gain.

    shdn => $int

Optional: Integer. This is the GPIO pin number if you decide to use the C<SHDN>
(hardware shutdown pin #9) on the chip. Typically, this can simply be tied to
3.3v or 5v which means the DACs will always be active. If you do use this pin,
you *MUST* make a specific call to C<$dac->enable_hw()> before using either of
the onboard DACs.

=head2 set

Writes a new analog output value to one of the onboard DACs.

Parameters:

    $dac

Mandatory: Integer. C<0> for DAC A, or C<1> for DAC B.

    $value

Mandatory: Integer. The new value to write to the DAC. See L</DESCRIPTION> for
the respective values for each IC model.

=head2 disable_sw

Disables a specified onboard DAC's output via software. Both DACs are enabled
by default.

Parameters:

    $dac

Mandatory: Integer. C<0> for DAC A, or C<1> for DAC B.

=head2 enable_sw

Re-enables a specified onboard DAC's output via software.

Parameters:

    $dac

Mandatory: Integer. C<0> for DAC A, or C<1> for DAC B.

=head2 enable_hw

NOTE: The MCP49xx DAC IC chips have a C<SHDN> pin, which when pulled LOW,
disables via hardware the output on both onboard DACs. Normally, this pin is
simply tied to 3.3v+ or 5v+ which informs the hardware that both DACs will
always be active.

If you decide you want to tie the C<SHDN> pin to a GPIO pin and control this
feature manually, you have to initialize your L<RPi::DAC::MCP4922> object by
setting the C<shdn => $gpio_pin_num> in your call to C<new()>. Then, before
either of the DACs can be used, this method (C<enable_hw()>) MUST be called.

Takes no parameters.

=head2 disable_hw

Disables, via the hardware's C<SHDN> pin, the outputs of both onboard DACs.

See L</enable_hw> for more information on this feature.

Takes no parameters.

=head2 register

This is a helper function which allows you to view the configuration register at
various stages of this software's operation. I tend to use it to ensure I'm
getting proper bit strings back from the various inner operations:

    printf("%b\n", $dac->register);

Takes no parameters, returns the decimal value of the register as it's currently
configured.

=head1 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

=head1 DEVICE SPECIFICS

The MCP49x2 series chips have two onboard DACs (referred to as DAC A and DAC B).

The 4902 unit provides 8-bit output resolution (value 0-255), the 4912, 10-bit
(0-1023), and the 4922, 12-bit (0-4095).

=head1 DEVICE OPERATION

The MCP49x2 series digital to analog converters (DAC) operate as follows:

    - SHDN pin is an override to physically disable the DACs. It can be tied to
      3.3v+ or 5v+ for always-on, or tied to any GPIO pin so you can control the
      physical shutdown by putting the GPIO pin LOW
    - on startup, put the CS pin to HIGH. This indicates that there is no
      conversation occuring
    - turn the CS pin to LOW to start a conversation
    - send 16 bits (the write register) over the SPI bus while CS is LOW
    - turn the CS pin HIGH to end the conversation
    - as soon as the last bit is clocked in, the specified DAC will update its
      output level

=head2 DEVICE REGISTER

The write register is the same for all devices under the MCP49x2 umbrella, with
the differing devices having differing sizes for the data portion. Following is
a diagram that depicts the register for the different devices, where C<x> shows
that the bit is available, with a C<-> signifying that this bit will be ignored.
Note that a full 16-bits needs to be sent in regardless of chip type.
